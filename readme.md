## Lab 1 Expectations

### Assignment

You should create a note taking application. This is intended for short notes. A user should be able to type out a note and add this note to a list that is displayed on the screen
A user should also be able to delete notes from this list and edit notes once they are in the list. Notes do not have to be persisted after the application stops, however, that is a stretch goal

###Rubric

- Functionality: 75%
	- Display list of notes: 10% (Of total)
	- Ability to add notes: 25%
	- Ability to delete notes: 20%
	- Ability to edit notes: 20%


- Code Quality: 25%
	- Following good MVC practices 12.5%
	- Following Android practices 12.5%



### Stretch goal

A note taking app doesn't have any real use if notes are erased when you close the application. Figure out a way to persist notes on your device. Likely this will mean using a database.
Android offers functionality to get access to a local SQLite database on the particular phone. More information on that can be found here http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html
